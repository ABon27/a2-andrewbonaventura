## Dice Roller
This website allows the user to roll dice of various types, possible options include d1, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100. The website also give you the option to roll multiple dice
of the same type and also a flat modifier that will add to or subtract from each individual dice roll. The resulting total is then produced and the number rolled appears on screen for each die. 
The results screen will show all previous rolls and results while the server was still active. 
The website is meant to address the problem of missing dice in some board game or playing D and D or similar game that requires dice.
For future work it may be useful to allow the user to roll different types of dice at the same time.

CSS changes:
The label input class causes labels and forms inputs to be placed beside each other as well as the dice Id which causes drawn dice to be placed beside each other. The heading class causes items within it to be horizontally centered on the page. The body and h1 HTML elements have unique styling. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using the innerhtml command from an HTML tag selected in the document, I was able to actually draw out a dynamic amount of dice for each submit of rolls from the javascript code
instead of the fixed HTML which allowed me to illustrate to the user what each die rolled as instead of just the final result.


### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I have made sure that the form inputs have error checks so that the user is unable to input potentially website breaking information and displayed to the user through
an error label where their form input is invalid and may need to be changed.
- **Design Achievement 2**: I made sure that when the website is run using the audit process in the chrome developer mode that the main page receives grades of 100 in all areas. The developer mode can
be reached by inspecting the main page of the website and then clicking the audit tab at the top will get you to where you can run it.
